# 🛡️ Linux Practice for Cybersecurity

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my **hands-on Linux practice for cybersecurity**, based on guided lab environments from **LabEx.io**.  
The focus is on building **practical Linux skills essential for cybersecurity, SOC analysis, and system administration**, through real command-line usage rather than theory alone.

All work here represents **my own practice, notes, and outputs**, created while completing structured labs.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Strengthen Linux command-line proficiency
- Understand Linux from a **security and defensive perspective**
- Practice tasks commonly required in **SOC, Blue Team, and Cybersecurity Analyst roles**
