🛡️ Linux, Shell & Bash for Cybersecurity

📌 Overview

This repository showcases my hands-on cybersecurity practice using Linux, Shell, and Bash scripting.
It focuses on defensive security, system visibility, and automation techniques commonly used in Security Operations Centers (SOC) and blue-team environments.

The projects and scripts here reflect how lightweight Linux tools can support:

Incident triage

Log analysis

System hardening

Operational monitoring

Threat detection workflows

🎯 Cybersecurity Learning Objectives

Analyze system and application logs using shell tools

Automate repetitive security tasks with Bash

Understand Linux permissions, users, and processes from a security perspective

Detect suspicious behavior through command-line analysis

Practice security-minded scripting aligned with real-world SOC workflows

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Linux (Ubuntu / Debian-based systems)

Bash / Shell scripting

Core utilities: awk, sed, grep, cut, sort, uniq, find

Process & network tools: ps, top, netstat, ss, lsof

Git & GitHub

Terminal-based analysis

🔍 Security-Focused Use Cases

📊 Log Analysis & Parsing
Identify errors, anomalies, and unusual access patterns from structured logs.

🔁 Security Automation
Automate backups, permission checks, and system audits using Bash.

🔐 Access & Permission Auditing
Inspect file permissions, ownership, and user configurations for misconfigurations.

🚨 Operational Security Monitoring
Track running processes, network connections, and system behavior.

🧪 Learning Sources & Attribution

Some foundational exercises and labs in this repository are inspired by hands-on cybersecurity labs completed on LabEx.io.

Labs are used for skill-building and practice only

Scripts are independently written or modified to demonstrate understanding

No proprietary lab solutions or restricted materials are shared

This repository represents my applied learning and personal execution, not direct reproduction of platform content.

📈 Progress & Methodology

Incremental commits show skill progression

Scripts evolve from basic commands to multi-step automation

Emphasis on readability, comments, and security context

Focus on practical defense-oriented scenarios

⚠️ Disclaimer

All scripts are provided for educational and demonstration purposes only.
They should be tested and reviewed before use in production or sensitive environments.
